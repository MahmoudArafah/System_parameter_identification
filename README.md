# System_parameter_identification

* in file "parameter identifcation algorithms" comparison between Recursive Least Squre Algorithm, Extended Least Square Method and Maximum Likelihood algorithms in presence of white noise on the system  
* in file "Excitation" comparsion between differrent input types to determine which one is more convenient in parameter estimation.
